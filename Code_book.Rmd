This is a *code book* to the **Data_set_mean.txt** tidy data set, located in this repo. For additional information on analysis see **README.md**.

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

Here are the data for the project:

For correct opening of file **Data_set_mean.txt** on your computer in R, copy it into the *work directory* and open use code:

```{r,message=FALSE,error=FALSE}
Data_set_mean <- read.table("Data_set_mean.txt", header = TRUE)

View(Data_set_mean)
```

**Data_set_mean** table has 180 rows and 68 columns.

### subject | column #1

Volunteers' numbers are from 1 to 30. The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
 
### activity | column #2

Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

Data on 6 activities for each participant is given in the table.

- [1] WALKING            
- [2] WALKING_UPSTAIRS  
- [3] WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS 
- [4] SITTING           
- [5] STANDING           
- [6] LAYING  

### average of mean and standard deviation for each activity and each subject | columns from #3 to #68

Average value of a 66-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables are included in the data set. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern ('-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions): 

*tBodyAcc-XYZ, 
tGravityAcc-XYZ, 
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ, 
tBodyGyro-XYZ, 
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ, 
tBodyAccMag, 
tGravityAccMag, 
tBodyAccJerkMag, 
tBodyGyroMag, 
tBodyGyroJerkMag, 
fBodyAcc-XYZ, 
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, 
fBodyGyro-XYZ, 
fBodyAccMag, 
fBodyAccJerkMag, 
fBodyGyroMag, 
fBodyGyroJerkMag.*

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: *mean(): Mean value* and *std(): Standard deviation*.

Finally, we have 33*2 = 66 variables in the table, which correspond its columns:

- [1] mean(tBodyAcc-mean()-X)          
- [2] mean(tBodyAcc-mean()-Y)          
- [3] mean(tBodyAcc-mean()-Z)
